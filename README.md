Clover Config & Files for HP EliteBook Folio 9480m Sierra Hackintosh
I had a horrible time getting this laptop up and running initially - I was able to get close with most config from the 9470m which is supported widely by tools such as the “HP ProBook Installer” but this notebook has a newer GPU (Intel HD4400), Series 8 Haswell board with i5 and a number of other changes.

I created this repo to give me a really simple method of collating all the files I needed for rebuild, primarily.
